## Sales and production Firm Data Analysis

Goal of the project is to answer various business questions about the all possible areas of the firm. These include sales, orders, customers, employes. Through multiple analysis we intend to understand different patterns in sales, orders, performance and products over a period of time. I have used excel to visualize insights found from the analysis. 

Main points taken into consideration for analysis are; product performance, orders and returns, growth over a period of time, and category based analysis with age, gender, region, time period.  

This dataset includes over 100+ queries answering almost all possible data points about a business.
